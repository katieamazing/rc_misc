I did a little game project recently in a new language. You've probably never heard of it.

It's called [Céu](http://ceu-lang.org/)! SDL bindings were added to the language super-recently. I wanted to try working in Céu as I've been learning (somewhat passively) about concurrency in Python, and making something in a language that is all about synchronous design and concurrency appealed to me. So it was an interesting and challenging experience to make a game in a couple days with these very young tools:

-no documentation

-not googleable

-bad error messages

On the plus side, there were twelve example programs that shipped with the SDL library. Those were what I referenced whenever I wanted to get something accomplished. Still, there were some really hard problems - getting a string variable that would be updated with the score turned out to be a huge problem. After trying to get it working for a few hours (!), I worked around the issue of having a text variable rendered to screen with a graphical score display.
Another plus was having someone to work with. [@Johicholas](link) has used Céu before, and he was incredibly helpful when it came to language features that were new to me. Such as:

-a helper function

-a class

It was nice having someone to bumble through the project with.
