presentation notes:
talk about what kinds of things are 2/3-day Games
talk very briefly about some technologies (sdl, webgl, unity, curses, pygame, Love2d, PICO-8, Ren'Py, Twine)
talk about resources (opengameart.org, kenney.nl, http://oryxdesignlab.com/sprites/ (katie has a copy of roguelike tileset), Wikimedia Commons, bfxr, sfxr)

- use version control
- try a test deploy early
- brainstorm hard, and don't necessarily go with the first idea
- trim your concept down to the minimum viable product; don't succumb to feature bloat
- use placeholders
- prepare for the 16-hours-in-hatred-of-everything
- keep motivation high, but manage your hatred of everything: for some, check out other people's progress. For others, take a break. For me, imagine the finish line.
- take care of your tools (YOU)
- leave time and energy for the last steps. The polish and deployment is 10% of the work and 90% of the effort.
