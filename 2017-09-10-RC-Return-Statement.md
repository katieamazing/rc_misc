title: "RC Return Statement"
date: TODO
---

-overall struggled with outside world distractions of the political kind
-the balance between RC-as-work and RC-as-social-reactor

-having a different idea of what RC would be from reading old blog posts from alums
  -no residents
  -less oversight/faciliator support (I was continually surprised by the disinterest of the staff)
  -larger groups/less batch cohesion
  -gender balance issues

-goal for this post is to provide a reflection on what RC was in the spring of 2017, with the caveat that the culture changes quickly with each batch.

-post a link to or a cut for the whole To-Do file.
