-having a different idea of what RC would be from reading old blog posts from alums
  -no residents
  -less oversight/faciliator support
  -larger groups

-goal for this post is to provide a reflection on what RC was in the spring of 2017, with the caveat that the culture changes quickly with each batch.

-post a link to or a cut for the whole To-Do file.
