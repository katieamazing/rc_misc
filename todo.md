  * Update: Didn't find a suite of itertools-specific problems. Might write my own in exercism.io style.
* [X] Instead, studied itertools and
* [X] Also did three beginning problems on exercism.io. Nice way to warm up, but unchallenging.

Day 5:
* [ ] Check in with Carolina
* [ ] Kick ass at greedy algorithm study day.
  * Update: NOOOPE.
  * Update 2: Came back to it later with my mentor, got it working. I feel slightly better about it, and also feel like I know where I went wrong earlier today. Rollercoaster!
* [X] Read some Bottles (over halfway done today)
* [X] Do some study/reading/tutorial to research elm-to-django POST/GET methods for KOLC (inherited from yesterday :persevere:)

* [X] Also read [this](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2013/05/27/TheTransformationPriorityPremise.html) article about TDD on the recommendation of 99 Bottles.
* [X] ate: an orange (short day, I went home for a late lunch) ($0)

Weekend:
* [X] Finish 99 Bottles
* [X] Make significant progress on KOLC
  * Update: didn't get a ton of new content done, but solved some sticky icky problems.
* [X] Do a simple flocking demo in love2d
* [ ] Do some research to select a short legacy program or function to refactor into Python 3 next week
* [X] Also worked on a shortest-distance maze solving bfs greedy algorithm from Algo Day

**Week 1 Summary:**
* Read: "99 Bottles of OOP: A Practical Guide to Object-Oriented Design", Metz/Owen
* Learned: Object Orientation, better refactoring practices, greedy algorithms (bfs, interval scheduling), flocking behavior, how to RC, many people's names
* Watched: intensely enjoyed tom7's [new video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA_DrBwkiJA)
* Feels: Still feeling uneasy about not settling into a project. My worries about social anxiety and having trouble working at RC are very eased after the week, so that's good. Definitely need to reach out for help/pairing more, as working with others was the highlight of my week.

Day 8:
* [ ] Poke around with PyBee app
* [X] Exercism
* [X] Refactor the flocking demo I worked on over the weekend
* [X] Read this thing: http://coding-geek.com/how-databases-work/
* [X] Watch this thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-5obm1G_FY
* [X] Also paired with Trent on Lua love.physics/all the objects game
* [X] ate: a salad, a bar of chocolate ($14)

Day 9:
* [X] Check in (really this time)
* [X] Take advantage of day at home to update my flashcards deck
* [X] DG project (formerly LPTHW project, started, will continue tomorrow. Should research mocking/testing OO code in Python to speed up.)
* [X] Read some Growing
* [X] Read this thing: https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/a-practical-introduction-to-functional-programming
* [X] Research RC jobs; see if there are any typical/in-common topics that I don't know; make a plan to learn the most pertinent/useful ones
  * Update: started - need to continue by talking to people, attending career panel, and having a chat with RC Jobs team. Tentative list for research/learning:
    * REST/RESTful (reading the origin paper)
    * MongoDB (as a counterpoint to SQL DBs learning)
    * RabbitMQ/GRPC (can I find a pleasant way to learn one of these? Look for tutorial/online course.)
    * AWS (and/or Google Cloud)
    * Containers/containerization, perhaps Docker
* [X] ate: many nice things, but at home ($0)
