**Week 4 Summary**
* Read: Barely started Fluent Python. This is a huge book, I knew it would take me two weeks to get through, but now I am thinking maybe more like 3 weeks.
* Attended: [Codeland](http://codelandconf.com/), a first time 2-day conference for programming newbies here in New York organized by the founder of Code Newbie. It was. SO. GOOD.
* Learned: Decision trees, dynamic programming, containerization/Docker, how great Code Newbie is.
* Feels: This week had some spectacular highs and some grim lows. I enjoyed myself all week but was not very productive, and then a weird social interaction happened that really knocked the wind out of my sails. I hid at home on Thursday. But attending Codeland was so exciting and inspiring, and it was nice to take a 4-day break from RC. I feel ready to tackle the sometimes-weirdly-hardmode RC social world all over again. I am dreading the departure of many of the friends I have made who will be leaving with the conclusion of their Spring 1 batch, so I want to be brave and social and soak up as much of them as I can in the next two weeks.

* Learned: Contributing to open source git practices, some stuff about type systems and functional design, started practicing white boarding
* Victorious: Got my very first ever PR to an open source project merged. I am a FOSS contributor! :satisfied:
* Feels: I gave myself permission to ignore my usual to-do list items this week, and focus on enjoying the departing people's last week. That really paid off last week and continued to do so this week (though I felt guilty about social stuff taking precedence last week, and I am much less guilty this week). I was ready to draw a crisp line and not drag out goodbyes, so I did not go in on Friday or over the weekend, and instead chose to start my break early!

* Feels: Feeling frustrated with RC - the large size of the incoming batch has made desk space a challenge again. And I'm feeling deeply annoyed/tortured over the gender disparity in the new batch - of 44 people, less than 10 are women. All compound to make me feel less welcome in the space/community. I am trying hard to combat this with off-hours socializing and running some events, and hoping I look back on this week with laughter, having grown deeply fond of Summer 1's.

**Week 8 Summary**
* Read: "Fluent Python"/Ramalho (still... hey, I'm more than halfway done now!), and "Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design"/Bird. Decided midweek to abandon "Pearls" - I feel I could get good stuff out of it if I were willing to spend 1-7 days on each chapter, but I am not. I'll come back to it in a few months.
* Learned: New stuff about testing, like the Jasmine framework for JavaScript and Busted for Lua.
* Organized: A second Refucktoring session, which went well! I was glad I'd pushed through on the JavaScript problem, and people also really liked the C project that I got JN to do.
* Watched: Lots more PyCon talks. I am done with the ones that interest me now.
* Feels: I'm still not feeling settled at RC, and my discomfort with the new demographics and vibe continue to impact me negatively. I had some interactions with staff this week that were mostly but not entirely encouraging. My anger and frustration last week really gave way to sadness and grieving this week, but I am feeling a little better now with some support from friends and pouring my energy into planning social outings with the people I like most. I have to admit that this week, I am looking forward to the end of my batch.

**Week 9 Summary**
* Read: Finished "Fluent Python"/Ramalho, YAY!
* Learned: some stuff about SDL, how little I know about algorithms, concurrency/parallelism and Céu
* Organized: A game jam! It went okay.
* Laughter: [This](https://www.designernews.co/stories/84443-redditors-design-worst-volume-sliders-possible) made me howl laughing this week
* Feels: My productivity is really low right now. I feel aimless and hopeless. Relatedly, I had two friends this week at RC who I consider(ed) to be allies in feminism say stupid, sexist, offensive shit to me this week. I called them both on it in the moment, and neither responded in a way that put me at ease. Depressing. I suspect it's that the current (male dominated, competive) RC climate enables these kinds of remarks. In any case, next week I need to buck up and refocus on my goals: finishing KOLC, finishing my Breakouts, progressing on technical interviewing skills.

**Week 10 Summary**
* Read: "Exercises in Programming Style", Cristina Videira Lopes. I read a few chapters of this book maybe 8 months ago, and quit because I found it dull. Now I find it FASCINATING. I see so much growth in how much I understand and how many of the presented styles I have experimented and worked with.
* Learned: Slow but steady work in my "tree flavored" Elm implementation of Breakout has given me a breakthrough this week about recursion rather than loops in functional languages. Cool!
* Social: The first ladies dessert outing was fun and lifted my spirits quite a lot. I hope it was as nice for other attendees, and I am excited about more of these to come.
* Feels: The weather was pretty awful this week. So hot! I revile hot weather, and I spend summers pretty miserable. I was pretty checked out on RC this week (stayed home two days, meant to go in on Sunday but flaked). I'm frustrated with my lack of focus, worried about jobs, sad about RC, and really really unhappy that the weather is so warm.

**Week 11 Summary**
* Read: "Grokking Algorithms", Aditya Y. Bhargava
* Learned: about tries, about the very frustrating PySDL2 - getting the tutorial working was fun and pleasant, but adding my own graphics has been painful and I am stuck.
* Practiced: Django stuff, went smoother than ever working on a project
* Watched: I wanted this helpful [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXjmTQ8LEoI) about tries, and watched [this silly internet video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL9iMPx9CpQ) like 7 times until I cried laughing
* Social: Invited Laura to come to Game Night which was great, met Ilona, my RC Buddy, who was really nice and v. inspiring
* Feels: Oh boy, this week. I stayed home all but two days (Thurs and Sat). A bit due to weather, a bit due to not wanting to deal with RC. I am looking forward to being finished. On the bright side, I had a busy week at home, and felt good about being where I was productive, regardless of that not being RC. I've also started working with some folks on Cracking the Coding Interview chapters, and that is intimidating but useful to do with programmers who are more advanced than me at this foundational CS stuff. Hope to cram in some more of that next week. Just four more days!
