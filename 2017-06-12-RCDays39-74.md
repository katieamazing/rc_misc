A long time has passed since updating this blog with my RC-doings!

There was a two week break in May, during which RC was not in session. I chose to skip the Never Graduate week reunion, which occurred over the first week of the break. I was ready for a break, and wasn't in a nostalgia-oriented headspace. The second week was mostly occupied with PyCon. I traveled to Oregon to attend my first PyCon, and it was a wonderful experience. Over the break, I got a lot less done than I wanted to. But I wrapped up a few things, and started some new ones. !!Con at the start of the break and PyCon at the end were amazing, and were where I spent a lot of my social energy.

My *book a week* project was stalled the last few weeks. I've been busy reading, but "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho has been long to get through. I had a really great experience meeting Luciano at PyCon, in fact. I mentioned I was reading the book, and he asked me how I was liking it. I was honest and said, "It is great, but long!" He was very sweet about it, and said if he was to do it all again, he might consider releasing the book as a series of 5 or 6 books. So by the author's own count, I am more or less on schedule for a book a week! I also read some of "Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design" by Richard Bird, but abandoned it halfway. It was interesting, but difficult to understand through the Haskell examples. I might return to it when I am willing to invest more time per chapter, trying to implement the algorithmic coolness in Python.
