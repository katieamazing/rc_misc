**April
Codeland 2017 - New York, New York**

Day 1: Diversity, joy, vulnerability, bravery, badasses, memes, bollywood dance party.
Codeland was a bit of an emotional mix for me: it was inspiring and welcoming, but at the same time I felt out of place. The conference is geared toward Code Newbies, and this was the first moment I realized that I was definitely not a newbie any longer. A highlight was meeting Katrina Owen, who was speaking, and who cowrote a book I had read recently and who is the founder of Exercism.io, a significant part of my programming journey. She is one of my heroes who has directly made programming more accessible to me. In an casual conversation, she graciously encouraged me to consider putting together a conference talk on a project I shared with her. Her encouragement and feeling like less of a newbie really got the gears turning in my head - maybe 2018 is the year of speaking rather than attending conferences.
